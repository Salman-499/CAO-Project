# CAO-Project
Alarm door system
Parts required for the project
1. breadboard
2. 4x4 keypad
3. mpu6050 accelerometer
4. esp32 
5. jumper wires
6. Led lights

->First install the library for mpu6050 accelerometer

There are different ways to get readings from the sensor. we’ll use the Adafruit MPU6050 library. To use this library you also need to install the Adafruit Unified Sensor library and the Adafruit Bus IO Library.
Open your Arduino IDE and go to Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries. The Library Manager should open.
Type “adafruit mpu6050” on the search box and install the library.
