Creating a simple applet that would trigger an event on receiving a request from the esp32.
The applet is created on the platform "www.ifttt.com".
The applet consists of two parts, 1) the trigger & 2) the event

->the trigger: 
It is a request sent from the esp32 to the applet with an api key. 
The trigger depends on the status of the reed switch connected to one of the esp32 GPIOS.
As soon as the reed switch closes or opens, the esp32 sends a trigger request to the applet.

->the event:
On receiving the trigger or request, the applet authenticates it using the API key and then sends a response email to the user.

The applet named, "door_status" is a private applet created on the ifttt website.
